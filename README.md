# Vensim-Experiments

This repository relates to the development of models related to Public Health or the application of its principles.

## Epidemiological approach to high-level Cyber-Resilience

This model explores the use of epidemiological models to 

* represent the process of zero-day vulnerability creation, 
* the infection of suceptible informtion systems by malware exploiting these zero day vulnerabilities, and 
* the creation of patches to neutralize malware that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

This model is part of a Journal paper *"A system dynamics, epidemiological approach for high-level cyber-resilience to zero-day malware"* currently under review by a peer-reviewed journal.

### Available files

The following files are available:
* A *pdf* file with a draft of the journal paper.
* An *mdl* file with a System Dynamics model that can be run in Vensim

## Ventilation_vs_Infectivity

This model explores the influence of ventilation on indoor viral infectivity.

This System Dynamcis model is based on a SIR Model, integrating the influence of Ventilation into the mechanics that lead to an infection. 

### Available Files

The following files are available:
* An *mdl* file with a System Dynamics model that can be run in Vensim, or 
* An *ipynb* file that can be opened as a Jupyter Notebook
